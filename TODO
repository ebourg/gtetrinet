GTetrinet's TODO list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Reintroduce MIDI support through GStreamer.

- Make gtetrinet resizeable (at least the fields messages bit)

- Write a User Manual. (see #105308)

- Remove all the GTET_O_* function calls. Do it in a safe way ;)

- g_locale_to_utf8 every string that gets in GTetrinet, and
  g_locale_from_utf8 every string that leaves GTetrinet.

- Allow the user to rearrange the players in the player list by just
  dragging them around.

- Port GTetrinet to the Tetrinet2 protocol. (see #105305)
